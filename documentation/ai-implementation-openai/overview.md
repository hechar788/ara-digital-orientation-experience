**Phase 2 Issues:**
- Path not found → Verify graph connections exist
- Performance slow → Check for infinite loops

**Phase 3 Issues:**
- AI not responding → Check OpenAI API status
- Function not called → Review system prompt

**Phase 4 Issues:**
- Path calculation fails → Verify Phase 2 working
- Empty path array → Check current location validity

**Phase 5 Issues:**
- UI not appearing → Check z-index conflicts
- Messages not displaying → Review state updates

**Phase 6 Issues:**
- Navigation jumpy → Adjust delay timing
- Progress not updating → Check state management

**Phase 7 Issues:**
- Props not wiring → Verify callback signatures
- Existing features broken → Check for naming conflicts

**Phase 8 Issues:**

### User Experience
```
User: "I need to find the library"
AI:   "The Library is southwest from here. From A Block, head down
       the main corridor and turn left at the atrium. Would you like
       me to guide you there?"
User: "Yes please"
AI:   "Route found: 7 steps. Starting navigation..."
      [Progress: Step 1 of 7] → Moving through A Block corridor
      [Progress: Step 2 of 7] → Turning at atrium
      ...
      [Progress: Step 7 of 7] → Entering library
AI:   "You've arrived at your destination!"
